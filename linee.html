             when I saw the way she looked at you, I knew she saw what I see every day kindness, sincerity, and the way
              you make me feel safe without even trying. It wasn’t just introducing you to my mom it was introducing you

            moments that meant everything. We didn’t run into the waves or play in the water. Instead, we just walked side by side,
             barefoot in the sand, talking about life, dreams, and silly little things only we would find funny. You looked at peace, 
             the kind of peace I’ve been looking for. We sat together on two simple chairs, facing the ocean, watching the sky slowly
              melt into a golden sunset. We shared stories, smiles, and that calm silence that somehow said more than a thousand words.
               It wasn’t about doing much it was about being there, together, and realizing how beautifully easy it felt to be around you</p>

              existed in that perfect in between of calm and closeness. I still remember the way you looked at me across the table,

             let time move slowly. You smiled at me between conversations, and I swear, in that light, you looked like my favorite 
             kind of peace. Café Nako gave us a simple space to sit, but in that simplicity, I found one of the softest memories I’ll
